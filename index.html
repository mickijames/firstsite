                    <p>
                        I am a junior at Eastern Washington University, double majoring in Visual Communication Design and Computer Science. My objective for the dual major is to be a Web Designer, but I'm keeping my options open for any other opportunities I may find myself enjoying.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Born and raised in Washington, I'm from Mabton &#8211; a small town in the Yakima Valley. My parents still live there on 5 acres, and I have 2 older sisters who are in various parts of the country now. My family likes to call our little country property a hobby farm. We have had cats, dogs, horses, chickens, sheep, and the occasional steer. I loved living out in the country. It really helps me appreciate the beauty of nature which compliments my native heritage.
                    </p> 

                    <p>
                        I grew up playing all kinds of sports: basketball, soccer, track, even a little football in Jr. High. I also love music. I've been playing piano since I was little, and I taught myself guitar as a freshman in high school. Other various interests include video games, movies, hiking, snowboarding and all manners of other outdoor activities. I like to travel occasionally, but my driving force for adventure is definitely my  family and friends.
