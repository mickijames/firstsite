    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
        I am a junior at Eastern Washington University, double majoring in Visual Communication Design and Computer Science. My objective for the dual major is to be a Web Designer, but I'm keeping my options open for any other opportunities I may find myself enjoying.
    </p>
    <p>
        I grew up here in Washington, in a small town called Mabton in the Yakima Valley, on what my family likes to call a hobby farm. We had cats and dogs, horses, chickens, sheep, and the occasional steer. I grew up playing all kinds of sports: basketball, soccer, track, even a little football in Jr. High. I also love music. I've been playing piano since I was little, and I taught myself guitar as a freshman in high school. Other various interests include video games, movies, hiking, snowboarding and all manners of other outdoor activities, especially if a group of friends is going.
